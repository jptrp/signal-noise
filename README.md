# Signal & Noise — V1

This repository hosts the first public surface for Signal & Noise.

V1 is intentionally minimal.

## Purpose

Publish the first canonical architecture artifact:

- `/architecture/structural-governance-in-ai-systems`

This site is a document host. Not a product. Not a blog engine. Not a marketing surface.

## Routes

- `/` — minimal homepage
- `/architecture` — index (single entry)
- `/architecture/structural-governance-in-ai-systems` — canonical post

## Guardrails (V1 constraints)

Do **not** add the following in V1:

- Markdown pipeline / content loaders
- CMS
- Analytics
- Tags, dates, feeds, pagination
- Product pages, services pages, pricing
- About / Contact / Newsletter
- Design ornament (gradients, glows, iconography, stock imagery)
- “We” voice or team framing

## Tone + Design

- Monochrome
- Whitespace-heavy
- Quiet, archival, notebook-like
- Embedded (uncaptioned) diagram is allowed
- The artifact should stand alone without explanation

## Dev

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy

Deploy with defaults (no env vars required).

## Checklist

- [ ] Still only 3 routes
- [ ] Still no “we”
- [ ] Still no content system
- [ ] Still monochrome + whitespace
